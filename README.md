# Electrical Energy Sales Visualization

This project analyzes electrical energy sales in India by state and consumer category over time. The data was cleaned to ensure clear and accurate visualizations.

## What I Did
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for better insights.
- Explored various charts (line, treemap, sunburst, pie, bar, animated bar) to highlight key trends and patterns.
- Focused on clear visuals with minimal clutter and meaningful colors.
- Added context and titles to help understand each chart.
- Created an interactive HTML dashboard combining all plots for easy exploration.

## Key Insights
- Energy sales have grown over the years.
- Top states and consumer categories are clearly identified.
- Interactive visuals help drill down into data by year, state, and category.

## About This Project
- Used AI to assist in generating Python code.
- Built the dashboard using Plotly and exported it as a standalone HTML file.
- The HTML file can be opened in any browser or hosted on GitHub Pages.

## How to Use
Open the `energy_sales_dashboard.html` file in a browser to explore the interactive charts.
